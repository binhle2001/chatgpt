# Bind your Klever account with your Google Account

One reason you should connect your Klever account with your Google Account is
so that you can log in to Klever with your Google account instead of typing
your email and password every time you want to log in.

 **To bind your Google account to Klever:**

  1. Select your profile picture at the right of the navigation, then select **Settings**.

  2. Select **Security** tab on the left side of the pop-up

  3. Select **Connect Google Account** button

Another pop up would show where you choose which google account to connect
your Klever Account with.

You're done! You can now log in to Klever with your Google account!
